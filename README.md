### Description
This project is duplicating the previous homework using Bootstrap.

I started with a fresh index and css file and added Nav from Bootstrap.

I then copied the body section of the previous homework. Day 2 we learned about containers, rows and columns so I switched the body section to the same.

From there, the portfolio was the most complex so I work on that bag adding the Bootstrap column system.

Contact page was the same, however much more simple.
