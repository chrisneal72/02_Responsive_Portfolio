                <p>Life for me began on a mild summer day, the tempature was below normal that day at 86 degrees. My family got by and we made due. I was not a great student and I got picked on a lot.</p>
                <p>After high school I joined the Air Force and got married. I served 3.5 years in Panama City Florida, where my daughter was born in 1992. After the Air Force I returned to Peoria IL to go to school to become an Architect. While going to school for Architecture I worked at a firm and discovered, I did not want to be an Architect. At the time I only knew Architecture and Drafting, so I got a job at an Engineering firm as a draftsman.</p>
                <p>In 1998 I discovered web design. While talking with a good friend I got a meeting with his boss. They used Macromedia Director. In order to get a job I taught myself the program, this was my introduction into coding. I spent many long nights after work teaching myself how to build interactive files using Director. Eventually I gained a job working with my friend. As the market for interactive CDs gave way to websites, I was moved to the Web Development team.</p>
                <p>Once on the web team I was give Adobe GoLive to use to build web pages. As bandwidth was limited in these days and our sites were graphic intensive I quickly learned to code using a text based editing software to keep the code more streamlined for the pages to load faster. Technology advanced and I started to teach myself Javascript to create a better user experience. Our backend code was PERL. As CSS evolved and Javascript matured I was able to make calls to the server with the Javascript. Eventually I started to dabble in the PERL code while waiting for a developer to be free to work on my project. Eventually I was able advance my career and promote to a Software Architect.</p>
                <p>Life happens, and I left web development late in 2010. My life after programming became diving, as I moved to Florida and became a scuba instructor for 3 years. From Florida I moved to Hawaii to run Hammerhead Spearguns and teach freediving for 4 years. This time away was a nice break, however I knew it was time to return to a career that has a bright future. Diving around the world is a fun job, however fun jobs don't pay well. I am now working at Amazon in an entry level job while I work my way back into a development position. I look forward to meeting my next employer that will have the honor of hiring me! I look forward to getting through the U of A sponsored Bootcamp and moving forward in a positive direction with my life.</p>
